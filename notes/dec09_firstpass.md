One strategy for approaching novel problems is to use Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques. Let’s break down each step a bit further and outline some things we can do to complete each step.

Understand
Read the problem. More than once if needed. A correct solution to the wrong problem won’t make your future boss too happy.
Don’t make assumptions. Clarify things. Ask questions. Reread the problem.
What type of data can we expect users to enter?
Do we need to handle invalid input?
What needs to be returned by this function?
Try explaining the problem to someone else or restating the problem to the asker.
Test your understanding by manually running through a test case with some easy-to-use sample data.
Plan
Think about the mental steps you followed when manually running through a test case. Write those out, then translate to operations and functions your program can run.
Look for steps that are repeating. These might be translated into a loop or helper function.
Use psuedocode to create an “outline” for your solution before writing the final version in the language of your choice.
Implement
Take the steps you outlined in your plan from step two and code it up!
Time permitting, write some test cases to ensure your solution works as intended.
Improve
